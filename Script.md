# 🔧 **New assumption (much more realistic)**

For a calm academic narrator in ElevenLabs:

👉 **Average speaking speed = 95–110 words per minute**
That is roughly:

- **8–9 words ≈ 1 second**
- A normal 15–20 word sentence ≈ **2 seconds**
- A longer 35–45 word sentence ≈ **4–5 seconds**

Your example sentence (~24 words) → **≈ 9–10 seconds** — which matches what you heard. So we will use this speed.

---

# 🎯 TARGET LENGTH: **~ 4:30 – 5:00 minutes**

You will still use:

- **10 video clips (mostly 8 seconds each)**
- **2 narrators (N1 = main, N2 = critical voice)**
  But I will **stretch the narration properly.**

# ✅ UPDATED SCRIPT WITH REALISTIC TIMING

(I write timing **based on slow, clear delivery in ElevenLabs**.)

---

## **0:00 – 0:08 — VIDEO 1 (Presenter in studio)**

**Narrator 1 (≈ 8 sec):**

> “Today, we explore how Artificial Intelligence is reshaping the philosophy of science.”

---

## **0:08 – 0:40 — VIDEO 2 (Robot arm + hologram)**

**Narrator 1 (≈ 30–32 sec):**

> “For centuries, science has been guided by observation, experimentation, and human reasoning.
> From Galileo’s telescope to modern supercomputers, every new technology has changed how knowledge is created, tested, and trusted.”

---

## **0:40 – 1:15 — VIDEO 3 (Popper & equations split screen)**

**Narrator 1 (≈ 30–35 sec):**

> “Philosopher Karl Popper argued that scientific theories must be falsifiable.
> This means they should make predictions that can be tested and potentially proven wrong.
> This idea became one of the foundations of modern scientific thinking.”

---

## **1:15 – 1:50 — VIDEO 4 (Neural network fly-through)**

**Narrator 1 (≈ 30–35 sec):**

> “Artificial Intelligence, especially neural networks, works in a different way.
> Instead of following clear rules written by humans, AI learns from vast amounts of data and discovers patterns that even experts may struggle to interpret.”

---

## **1:50 – 2:25 — VIDEO 5 (AI in laboratory with proteins)**

**Narrator 1 (≈ 30–35 sec):**

> “In biology, chemistry, and medicine, AI now helps analyze molecules, design new drugs, and simulate complex systems.
> Rather than replacing scientists, AI acts as an extremely powerful scientific assistant.”

---

## **2:25 – 2:55 — VIDEO 6 (Brain vs AI split screen — NEW CLIP B)**

**Narrator 2 (≈ 25–30 sec, slower and reflective):**

> “But this raises a deep philosophical question.
> Does Artificial Intelligence truly understand knowledge, or is it only simulating understanding through mathematical patterns?”

---

## **2:55 – 3:30 — VIDEO 7 (Human + AI together)**

**Narrator 1 (≈ 30–35 sec):**

> “Some philosophers believe that real knowledge requires consciousness and meaning, which machines do not have.
> Others argue that if AI consistently produces correct and useful scientific results, its internal understanding may not be essential.”

---

## **3:30 – 4:00 — VIDEO 8 (Future city)**

**Narrator 1 (≈ 30 sec):**

> “Historically, science has evolved through major paradigm shifts, as described by Thomas Kuhn.
> Many scholars now suggest that AI represents the next transformation in scientific practice.”

---

## **4:00 – 4:30 — VIDEO 9 (Neural network visual — loop)**

**Narrator 1 (≈ 30 sec):**

> “Unlike traditional tools, AI does not simply follow instructions.
> It can generate hypotheses, make predictions, and sometimes reveal patterns that humans did not originally expect.”

---

## **4:30 – 5:00 — VIDEO 10 (Future AI Lab — NEW CLIP C)**

**Narrator 1 (≈ 30 sec, conclusion):**

> “In conclusion, Artificial Intelligence does not remove the need for human reason.
> Instead, it expands and challenges our understanding of knowledge.
> The future of science will be a collaboration between human insight and intelligent machines.”

# ⏱ **New time estimate (much more accurate)**

| Section    | Time                 |
| ---------- | -------------------- |
| Intro      | 0:08                 |
| Segment 2  | 0:32                 |
| Segment 3  | 0:35                 |
| Segment 4  | 0:35                 |
| Segment 5  | 0:35                 |
| Segment 6  | 0:30                 |
| Segment 7  | 0:35                 |
| Segment 8  | 0:30                 |
| Segment 9  | 0:30                 |
| Conclusion | 0:30                 |
| **TOTAL**  | **≈ 4:50 – 5:10** ✅ |

This will comfortably sit in your **4–7 minute requirement.**

# 🎙 How to record this in ElevenLabs (important)

When you generate the voices:

**For Narrator 1 (main):**

- Speed: **-10% or -15% slower than default**
- Tone: calm, neutral, academic

**For Narrator 2 (critical voice):**

- Speed: **-15% slower**
- Slightly deeper / more reflective tone
